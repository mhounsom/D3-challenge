          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>

          <p>For Smoking vs. Income, it can be seen that as income rises, the percentage of people smoking decreases. 
            It would be interesting to see what activities occupies that smoking time for people with higher incomes. </p>

          <p>For Healthcare vs. Poverty, a correlation that can be seen that most people correlate, even without a chart is that as poverty rises, the percentage of people with healthcare 
            decreases. As that makes logical sense since people who have to be tight with their finances may not have health insurance at the top of their list since it does not directly impact
            them each day.
          </p>

          <p>There does not seem to be any correlation with ages and any of the Y-Axis variables. For all three variables, they are all in one general area where we can see the Median
            age is very similar in most states.
